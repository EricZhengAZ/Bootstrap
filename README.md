# Bootstrap

Steps：
      1. Setup some tools for Bootstrap
      2. Write a resume.
      3. learn the fundamantal of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
      4. Read some Bootstrap Templates
      5. Write my own webpage for my resume.

Note: I don't really want to just modify a template, so I tried several times to write my own resume page according to what I have learnt about HTML and Bootstrap.
