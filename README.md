# Bootstrap

Steps：
      1. Setup some tools for Bootstrap
      2. Write a resume.
      3. learn the fundamantal of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
      4. Read some Bootstrap Templates
      5. Write my own webpage for my resume.

Note: 
      1. I don't really want to just modify a template, so I tried several times to write my own resume page according to what I have learnt about HTML and Bootstrap. 

      2. You might want to download the folder in this project and run the html file in it to get this resume page fully functional.
      
Thank you!
